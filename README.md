# Vow Software

My name is Vow. I'm a software engineer with a strong interest in game development and teaching, however I also ocassionally delve into other domains. I prefer to learn things deeply and have as much control as possible over the technical details of my projects. My ultimate goal is to create fun and innovative games, while sharing some of my knowledge in the process.

I maintain a [technical journal](https://github.com/VowSoftware/journal). I write about my daily experiences as a software developer, make progress updates on my own projects, discuss topics I see floating around the Internet, reflect on past successes and failures, and instill new knowledge that I gain while making cool stuff.

I create libraries for the Defold game engine, which I've been using since 2019. I also ocassionally contribute directly to the engine.
