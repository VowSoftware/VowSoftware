# Vow Software

My name is Vow. I'm a software engineer with a strong interest in game development and teaching, however I also ocassionally delve into other domains. I prefer to learn things deeply and have as much control as possible over the technical details of my projects. My ultimate goal is to create fun and innovative games, while sharing some of my knowledge in the process.

I maintain a [daily developer journal](#https://github.com/VowSoftware/journal). A new entry is created each day that I learn something new, make progress on a project, or just want to spill some thoughts. Check it out for interesting and informative blog-style posts.

I create libraries for the Defold game engine, which I've been using since 2019. I also ocassionally contribute directly to the engine.

* [Starly](https://github.com/VowSoftware/starly) is an orthographic camera library for Defold.
